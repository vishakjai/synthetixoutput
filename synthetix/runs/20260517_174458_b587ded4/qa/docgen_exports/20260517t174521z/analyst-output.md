## 4. Data Layer

## 4a. Functional Requirements

### FR-002 — Contractor Placement Management (P0)

Ensure contractor placement workflows are preserved and enhanced.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Placements must be searchable by recruiters with filters.
- Placement status updates must trigger notifications.
- The system must support placement history tracking.

*Grounding: matched 1 legacy term*

### FR-004 — AM Compliance Tracking (P1)

Implement tracking for Account Manager compliance scores.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Compliance scores must be calculated based on predefined rules.
- Scores must be visible on the AM dashboard.
- Alerts must be generated for non-compliance.

*Grounding: matched 3 legacy terms*

## 4b. Non-Functional Requirements

| ID | Title | Category | Acceptance criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| NFR-002 | Security Compliance | security | All data must be encrypted in transit and at rest.; Access controls must be implemented per role requirements.; Security audits must be conducted quarterly. |

## 4b1. Business Rules

Business rules extracted from the legacy codebase — these must be preserved in the modernized system.

| ID | Type | Rule | Scope | Evidence | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| BR-001 | calculation_logic | Compliance score is calculated based on placement details. | AM Compliance | Controller/ComplianceController.php | 90% |

## 4c. Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Potential data loss during migration. | high | Implement thorough data migration testing and validation. |
| Integration with third-party systems may fail post-migration. | medium | Conduct integration testing with all third-party systems. |

## 5. Blocking Decisions

| ID | Decision | Options | Impact if deferred |
|---|---|---|---|
| DEC-VB6-UI-001 | Target UI framework for modernized application | WinForms (.NET) · WPF · Blazor · Web (React/Angular) | Form migration strategy, event-handler mapping, and control replacement all depend on this choice. |
| DEC-VB6-DATA-001 | Data access strategy replacing DAO/ADO recordsets | Keep ADO.NET · Migrate to Entity Framework Core · Hybrid (ADO.NET for legacy, EF Core for new) | Every form with SQL touchpoints is affected. Wrong choice means rework on recordset-heavy forms. |

## 6. Migration Strategy

### Phase 0 — Database Contract Lock
Freeze schema for 0 database file(s). Document all connection string variants. Establish a migration-safe baseline before touching any forms.

### Phase 1 — Data-Entry Form Migration (0 forms)
Migrate data-entry forms first — they have the highest business value and the most SQL touchpoints. Each form migrates as a unit: UI + event handlers + recordset operations.

### Phase 3 — Navigation Shell & Authentication (0 navigation forms)
Replace the MDI shell and navigation forms. If a login form exists, implement the identity model per DEC-VB6-IAM-001.

### Phase 4 — Shared Module Consolidation (0 .bas modules)
Consolidate global state from shared modules into proper dependency injection. Eliminate public variables and replace with configuration/service abstractions.

## 7. Quality Gates

| Gate | Metric | Value | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Form dossier coverage | Forms with coverage > 50% | 0/0 | WARN |
| Event handler coverage | Handlers with procedure summaries | 0/0 | WARN |
| SQL injection risk | Handlers with injection_risk flag | 0 | PASS |
| Dead form references | Unresolved form references | 0 | PASS |
| Orphan forms | Unused forms requiring disposition | 0 | PASS |
| Backlog completeness | Remediation items vs discovered scope | 0 items | WARN |

## 8. Remediation Backlog

| ID | Priority | Item | Acceptance criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| RM-001 | P1 | No specific remediations identified | Review form dossiers for coverage gaps. |
